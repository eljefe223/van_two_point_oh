The battery will be constructed of 280AH cells.  It will be installed behind the driver side rear wheel.

## Cell Insulation

According to the Will Prowes' forum, the aluminum cased cells have positive terminal voltage on the outer case.  This means each group of cells will need to be isolated from each other and from any structure.  This will be accomplished by FR4 sheet.

## Cell Compression

EVE engineers recommend approximately 12 PSI, with no more than 17 PSI, to be maintained on the cells.  Allegedly this increases rated cycles from 2500 to 3500.  They also identify approximately 1 mm expansion between 0 and 100% SOC.  This will be accomplished by threaded rod preloaded with belleville washers arranged to give adequate pressure over the expected displacement.  Aluminum sheet will be used for the compression plates.  [This forum post has lots of good information](https://diysolarforum.com/threads/source-of-belleville-washers-for-300kgf-fixture.16733/).  Plan for about [$100](https://www.mcmaster.com/belleville-disc-springs/for-shaft-diameter~1-2/) in belleville washers.
