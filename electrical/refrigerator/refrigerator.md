## Fridge Options

Vitrifrigo has a separate compressor/condenser that might be good for arranging and optimizing airflow.  Thats what was used by [Lorax](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-997532).  Local dealer is Annapolis Cruisair 410-224-0970

Note: the C75 External is equivalent external to the C60 Internal cooling model.
