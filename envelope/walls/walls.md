In an effort to minimize any organic (read mold nuturing) materials, we are considering plastic as the basis for the walls.  The plan is to use a material similar to the stock wall panels that we had in our Sprinter upon reciept.   This material is a possible candidate: [https://corrugatedplastics.net/4mmFlutedCorrugatedPlasticSheets.html](https://corrugatedplastics.net/4mmFlutedCorrugatedPlasticSheets.html)

The corrugated plastic sheet would be covered by a layer of closed cell neoprene (probably 1/8") and a fabric.  One fabric to consider is [marine vinyl](https://www.marinevinylfabric.com/products/marine-vinyl-fabric).  

### Adhesive compatibility

>​	Sorry for the delay I wanted to get you a good answer. Most customers have said the best adhesive is a HH66 vinyl cement.
>**Nathaniel Costello:**
>​	Great. Do you know if anyone has used 3M77 or 3M90 succesfully?
>**www.MarineVinylFabric.com:**
>​	Typically 3M offers incredible products I would read their documentation for applications and environmental uses.

[3M80](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Rubber-And-Vinyl-80-Spray-Adhesive/?N=5002385+3293194236&rt=rud) literally looks like it was made to bond vinyl to neoprene.
