Requirements

Electrical

With the 24V nominal DC system, the solar panels need to provide a voltage in excess of 24V to ensure enough headroom for the MPPT to charge the battery.  Higher panel voltage will also allow reduced wire diameter.

Dimensional

With the Hein/Angle based roof mounting concept, 

## Selection

Based on our experience, we will be using a Victron inverter/charger.  The two choices, given our 24V DC system, are the Multiplus 3000VA  and the Multiplus Compact 2000VA inverter/chargers.
