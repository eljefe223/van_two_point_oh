**Questions:**

Don't forget about wheel well liners!

Scuff plates looke like the thing on the back! (Scuff plate kit vs heavy duty scuff plate kit)

What is Front and Rear view camera (61D)?  Why needed? Includes Side Senging (94R) and Reverse Sensing (43R) Requires 8" display (58X, 58Y, or 584).  [Here is one post on backing up with it](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/a-popular-hr-extended-cargo-van-arrives-at-matt-ford.81413/post-1059979). [Another post with some information about it](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/2020-transit-front-rear-split-view-camera.78215/#post-1029072). [cheap add to adventure package]

What is side sensing system 94A?  Where are the sensors? Is this part of BLIS? A: Includes BLIS - sounds a chime when vehicle gets close to surrounding vehicles and objects.   Basically like a side facing parking sensor.

Rear bumber delete?  Does this make sense with new aftermarket bumper.  Does aftermarket bumper make sense with hinge box storage?  Does aftermarket bumper work with reverse sensing system 43R?

Aftermarket security vs Perimeter alarm

What is radio prep package (58T) (no radio)

Whats is my key (62B) (allows programable limits e.g. speed per key)

Is the shelf new/different than previous years? (I think just an option now)

What about the Power Outlet..downsides? (no programable battery guard allowed)

What about the Vehicle maintenance Monitor?

Engine Block Heater? - Recommended if temp is 10F or below

Standard radio vs SYNC3

What is 85B Heavy Duty Scuff Plate Kit? (thing on the back and side step)

Can you have both 60C and 60D (Cruise Control and Adaptive Cruise) (Do you need both)

What wheels are standard? (642 for upgraded front axle SRW)

Is there and aftermarket film for safety glass

Read up on 59C (programmable battery guard)

**No mudflaps?**

**Notes: **

Radios: 58Y (no NAV) vs 584 (yes NAV)

Power outlet is not compatible with Programable Battery Guard
