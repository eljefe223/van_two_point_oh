With 3 inches of XPS on the sides of the battery, the total thermal resistance is 4.48 C/W.  This only accounts for the sides and bottom of the container.  A minimal 10 Watts would drive a delta-T of 44.8 C over outside ambient temperatures.  Easy to heat, but will get too hot during charge and heavy load.  For perspective.  Assuming 0.3 mOhm internal cell resistances, a 16 cell 24V battery will disipate 21W during a 200A charge.  This means the battery MUST exchange heat with the van internals via the top.  We might need a hot weather "mode" that allows heat exchange with the outside.
