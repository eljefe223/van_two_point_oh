## Fridge Options

Vitrifrigo has a separate compressor/condenser that might be good for arranging and optimizing airflow.  Thats what was used by [Lorax](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-997532).  Local dealer is Annapolis Cruisair 410-224-0970

Note: the C75 External is equivalent external to the C60 Internal cooling model.

A forum user found some online materials that suggest the external cooling unit can be placed up to [4 ft away from the fridge/freezer](https://www.fordtransitusaforum.com/threads/the-lorax-build-thread.72698/post-1073410).

I took some measurements of our Isotherm Cruise 130 to establish our current usable volume.  If you just discount space for the cooling unit, we have 119L.  If you also discount for the freezer, which has never really been used, you get 95L.  Usable volume of the Vitrifrigo 75 and 55 is 130L total,  75L of fridge volume and 55L of freezer volume.  A standard RedBaron frozen pizza fits on its edge vertically, and standard ice cube trays also fit.
