The right tool for the right job!

**Transfer Punch Set** - These are used to "transfer" a pattern of holes from one piece to another.  Note, when transfering holes from thin materials, the raised part that dimples the material can prevent the circumference of the transfer punch from locating itself relative to a hole.

Examples: [Harbor Freight Transfer Punch set](https://www.harborfreight.com/28-piece-transfer-punch-set-3577.html)

**Centering Transfer Center Punch** - This is useful if there isn't enough "meat" or thickness around a hole to locate a traditional transfer punch.  An example is trying to center a hole through L-track where the bottom of the chamfer is too thin to properly locate a transfer punch.

Examples: [Penn Tool Hole Transfer Center Punch](https://www.penntoolco.com/precise-econo-pic-hole-transfer-center-punch-3-16-1-1-16-tt-551/)

**Transfer Screw Set** - These are useful to locate holes on the backside of a piece.  Say I have 4 1/4-20 threaded holes in a wall and you need to mount a panel to that wall.  You insert the transfer screws int to the threaded holes, place the panel against the wall, and dimple the backside by pressing the panel against the transfer screws.  Remove and drill the proper locations.
